## 👋 Hi! Welcome to my space 👽 

### Who am I?
Hey there, how's it going? I'm Renan, a cybersecurity analyst focused on offensive security and application security. I work on a variety of scopes including mobile, web, internal, physical, and network security, with an emphasis on secure architecture, pentesting, and Red Team Ops. <br>
I have a background as a Full Stack Developer, which really helps me understand systems end to end, from both defensive and offensive perspectives. <br>
In my free time, I'm passionate about anime, games, and music, and I enjoy documenting what I learn through articles, projects, or talks.

### Certification & Skills
- CWES, eMAPT, CRTA, CMPen-Android, PMPA, SYAP, SYCP, HTB Pro Labs (Genesis, Dante & Orion) <br>
- Pentesting (Web, Mobile, Internal, External, Physical) | Mobile Security | Application Security | Security Architecture | Red Team | Full Stack Developer (Python, PHP, Java)

### List of crazy things
- I once decided it was a great idea to build a fully functional EDR using a high-level language. Pure madness… and the craziest part is that it actually worked.
- I write exploits and random tools out of nowhere, usually to automate things that were supposed to stay manual. At this point, it's basically a personality trait.
- I helped build a complete Cyber Threat Intelligence solution for detecting and mitigating fraud across third-party communication channels. Digging into protocol internals got way more fun than it should’ve been.
